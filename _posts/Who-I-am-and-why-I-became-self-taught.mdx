Hey there and thank you for taking the time to read about my adventures in becoming a self-taught developer. Spoiler alert: It's been the best decision of my life.

## Who Am I?

I'm Wassim Nassour, a 25-year-old self-taught Fullstack developer from the lively city of Casablanca, Morocco. Tech has been my passion since childhood, and I'm that friendly guy always hungry to learn and grow.

I craft clean, readable, and high-quality code, using the latest and greatest in web development like React, React Native, Next.js, Nodejs , Golang and more.

## Why I Ditched University for the Self-Taught Path?

Back in the day, my family called me the "Chinese man" because I was the neighborhood tech guru fixing TVs and phones. Growing up without a personal computer, I hit up cyber cafes (expensive, right?).

In high school, I aimed for an IT education but faced a hurdle â€“ not enough marks for the ideal school. So, I tried the Vocational Training and Occupational Promotion Bureau (OFPPT), got rejected, felt broken, and ended up in university studying economics (not my vibe).

Unwilling to throw in the towel, I dove into web development through online courses. Despite a second OFPPT rejection, I found the irony amusing. Morocco's education system lacked content, good teachers, and clung to old tech. Marks over skills? Not my thing.

I pondered if my dream of becoming a developer was over. Research showed success stories of devs without degrees. Meeting self-taught devs at local events gave me the push. Despite family and friends thinking I was making a mistake, I embraced the challenge. Convincing them failed, but this was my life, my dreams. So, I started my self-taught journey, glued to my screen from sunrise to sunset, learning and practicing every day since 2019.

And now? I'm a Front-end Developer at maltem, with 4 years of experience surrounded by incredible minds. Leading front-end projects? Hell yeah! I'm darn proud of myself.

Thank you for being part of my journey. ðŸ™Œ
