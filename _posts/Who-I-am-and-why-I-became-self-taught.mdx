Hello and thank you for being here,  reading this article that talks about me and my story on how I toke serious decisions to leave university and became a self-taught developer. And I think this is a best decions i made I toke in my whole life.

# **Who I am?**

## X XX XXX XX

Let me introduce my self , my name is wassim nassour self-taught,21 years old, from Casablanca (Morocco) self-taught React/React Native developer , I’ve been passionate about technology since I was a kid. i'm someone friendly and ambition to learn and grow and gain more experience.

I write clean and readable also high-quality code using current best practices in web development , by using many technologies such us React ,React Native , Redux , Gatsby, Nextjs.... ,

In my downtime, I enjoy reading about tech, or watching some tutorials in addition i 'm start blogging in my [blog](https://wassimnassour.vercel.app/blog/1) .

## Why I drop out Of university and i became i self-taught

When I was young I always had this passion for computers and technology, my family always called me the Chinese man because I fix the TV and their phones. I grew up without having a laptop or desktop to learn something because I can’t afford one, just go to a cyber cafe and you know it was very expensive to me.

So in high school I decided that I will continue my education in the IT field. But I faced a problem. I didn't get enough marks in baccalaureate to enter to a school that fits me well. So the only option I had is to went to the Vocational Training and Occupational Promotion Bureau   (OFPPT) and I got surprised. I'm rejected. i felt i’m broken and disappointed,  so i went to university in the field of the economy but i feel i’m not doing well and this is not my place, wherefore i didn't give up and i started learning web development from online courses, the second year i went again to the Vocational Training and Occupational Promotion Bureau and in the second time i got rejected, this is funny. so Let me give you quick information about education in Morocco. the system had lack in content and good teachers also They use old technologies . and   accept by mark not by skills or how you love this work.

so i started thinking is this the end of the road to be developer or i still have a chance to be developer , So I had to do some research to see if I can get a chance to work without a degree. I found many people who don’t have a degree and they have a position as a developer or  software engineer….  . Also  i went some events in my city and i had the chance to meet some developers , and some of them friend’s now  and some of them self-taught too  also they confirm my research that i can do it , so i take the challenge  and wherever my family and some friends  doesn't accept that  and they said to me that  i’m doing mistake, I Got a lot of problems with my family because  they just saw me as Someone without an education  or job like I’m just wasting my time ,i **tried** to convinced them and no result, so i took the challenge and I complete in my in way because this is my life and  this is the only option I have to achieve some  dreams and goals I have ,  so I start my journey as self-taught , so I wake and set the front of my screen from morning until night learning and doing some examples everyday from 09/09/2019 until today ,

as result now i'm working now as Front-end developer at Obytes compony that containe many great devlopers , also i had the chance to lead some front end projects , amvery proide of my self .

Thank you
