Hello and thank you for being here, reading this article that talks about me and my story on how I took serious decisions to leave university and became a self-taught developer. And I think this is the best decision I made I toke in my whole life.

## Who I am?

Let me introduce myself, my name is wassim nassour self-taught,22 years old, from Casablanca (Morocco) self-taught React/React Native developer, I’ve been passionate about technology since I was a kid. I'm someone friendly and ambitious to learn and grow and gain more experience.

I write clean and readable also high-quality code using current best practices in web development, by using many technologies such as React, React Native, Redux, Gatsby, Nextjs....,

In my downtime, I enjoy reading about tech, or watching some tutorials also I start blogging in my blog.

## Why did I drop out Of university and became self-taught?

When I was young I always had this passion for computers and technology, my family always called me the Chinese man because I fix the TV and their phones. I grew up without having a laptop or desktop to learn something because I can’t afford one, just go to a cyber cafe and you know it was very expensive to me.

So in high school, I decided that I will continue my education in the IT field. But I faced a problem. I didn't get enough marks in baccalaureate to enter a school that fits me well. So the only option I had is to went to the Vocational Training and Occupational Promotion Bureau (OFPPT) and I got surprised. I'm rejected. I felt I’m broken and disappointed, so I went to university in the field of the economy but I feel I’m not doing well and this is not my place, wherefore I didn't give up and I started learning web development from online courses, the second year i went again to the Vocational Training and Occupational Promotion Bureau and in the second time I got rejected, this is funny. so Let me give you quick information about education in Morocco. the system had a lack of content and good teachers also use old technologies . and accept by mark not by skills or how you love this work.

so i started thinking is this the end of the road to be a developer or I still have a chance to be a developer, So I had to do some research to see if I can get a chance to work without a degree. I found many people who don’t have a degree and they have a position as a developer or software engineer…. . Also I went to some events in my city and i had the chance to meet some developers, and some of them a friend’s now and some of them self-taught too also they confirm my research that i can do it, so i take the challenge and wherever my family and some friends don't accept that and they said to me that I’m doing mistake, I got a lot of problems with my family because they just saw me as Someone without an education or job like I’m just wasting my time, i tried to convince them and no result, so i took the challenge and I complete in my in a way because this is my life and this is the only option I have to achieve some dreams and goals I have, so I start my journey as self-taught, so I wake and set the front of my screen from morning until night learning and doing some examples everyday from 09/09/2019 until today,

as result now I'm working now as a Front-end developer at Obytes company that contains many great developers, also I had the chance to lead some front-end projects, am very proud of myself.

Thank you
